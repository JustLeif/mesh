## Core Workflow

1. Triage issues raised by community in discord.
2. Team select and solidify issues to put in Github.
3. Community also directly create issues in Github.
4. All validated issues / feature requests go into `Backlogs` of [Mesh Opensource Project](https://github.com/orgs/MeshJS/projects/1).
5. Components owner move issues from `Backlogs` into specific component projects. Or moving directly from discord if identified as high priority
6. Components owner define schedule and dev power from each project level
